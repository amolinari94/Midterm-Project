## Student Introduction
### Programming Experience
My experience with programming started in the summer of 2021.  I began the [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on 'Udemy' based on a suggestion from a close family friend.  

After some of the introductory tutorials, I started with a few small coding challenges that forced me to be deliberate and thoughtful with the code I was writing, and after troubleshooting my first program, hitting **_run_**, and seeing it work properly, I was hooked.
